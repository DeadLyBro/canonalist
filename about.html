  <h2 id="it-s-time-to-move-beyond-photoshop-">It&#39;s time to move beyond Photoshop.</h2>
  <p>The manga industry has moved online over the last 10 years, but scanlation tech hasn&#39;t kept up. Photoshop
    remains the standard and is quite powerful, but it&#39;s also 1) pricey, 2) complicated, and 3) not
    scanlation-specific. <a href="https://scanlate.io">scanlate.io</a> is an attempt to rethink what the process could
    look like: online, AI-assisted tools, simple enough for anyone to pick up.</p>
  <p>It&#39;s still very early, but we&#39;ve got:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-based Japanese detection &amp; translation</li>
    <li>Bubble dragging and resizing</li>
    <li>Typesetting controls</li>
    <li>Export to .png</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What&#39;s next:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More fonts</li>
    <li>Redrawing tools</li>
    <li>Multi-page upload?</li>
    <li>Collaboration?</li>
    <li>Your ideas here!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="how-do-i-start-">How do I start?</h2>
  <p>If have no previous experience with scanlating, that&#39;s fine! We all started somewhere =) Here's an intro 
    to the main roles involved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="assets/wpbubbles01.jpg" target="_blank">Translating</a></strong> -- rewriting the script for a different audience</li>
    <li><strong>Redrawing</strong> -- editing away the
      Japanese characters</li>
    <li><strong><a href="assets/typesettingguide102.png" target="_blank">Typesetting</a></strong> -- artfully filling in English text</li>
    <li><strong>Quality checking</strong>
      -- identifying mistakes in any of the above</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Hi! I&#39;m Austin (a.k.a. akrolsmir), leader of <a href="http://flow.moe/tag/scans/">Flow Scans</a>. Besides
    coordinating releases, I&#39;ve played a wide range of roles, from translating to typesetting to QC to (very, very
    basic) redrawing.</p>
  <p>By day, I&#39;m a freelance software engineer; previously I&#39;ve worked at Google, Microsoft, and various
    startups. Ideas for scanlate.io? Or want to hire me? Reach me at <a
